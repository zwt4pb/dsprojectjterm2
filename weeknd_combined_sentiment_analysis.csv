Blinding Lights,"Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights

Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)

Sacrificed for the greater good, then that's what it gotta be

You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay (Never again, baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you (Hey)
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind (Uh)

Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time (No)
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time (Hey)
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)
[Outro: The Weeknd &

Ooh, singin', out of time
Said I had you to myself, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Uh)
Out of time (
Pretend—

Out of time (

Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever

LA FAMA,"[Letra de ""LA FAMA"" ft. The Weeknd]

[Verso 1: ROSALÍA]
Lo que pasó a ti te lo cuento
No creas que no dolió o que me lo invento
Así es que se dio
Yo tenía a mi bebé, era algo bien especial
Pero me obsesioné con algo que a él le hacía mal
Miles de cancione' en mi mente
Y él me lo notaba
Y él tanta’ vece' que me lo decía
Y yo como si nada

[Coro: The Weeknd]
Es mala amante la fama, no va a quererte de verdad
Es demasia'o traicionera, y como ella viene, se te va
Sabe’ que será celosa, yo nunca le confiaré
Si quiere', duerme con ella, pero nunca la vayas a casar

[Verso 2: The Weeknd]
Lo que pasó me ha dejado en vela
Ya no puedo ni pensar
La sangre le hierve, siempre quiere más
Puñalaítas da su ambición
En el pecho afilada, es lo peor

[Coro: ROSALÍA]
Es mala amante la fama y no va a quererme de verdad
Es demasia'o traicionera, y como ella viene, se me va
Yo sé que será celosa, yo nunca le confiaré
Si quiero, duermo con ella, pero nunca me la voy a casar

[Puente: ROSALÍA & The Weeknd]
No hay manera
De que esta obsesión se me fuera
Se me fuera, ya desaparezca
Yo aún no he aprendío' la manera
No hay manera que desaparezca

[Coro: The Weeknd & ROSALÍA]
Es mala amante la fama, no va a quererte de verdad
Es demasia'o traicionera, y como ella viene, se te va
Yo sé que será celosa, yo nunca le confiaré

The Morning,"I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
""Listen, listen""

From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work

Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (The money is the motive)
All that money
The money she be folding (The money she be folding)

I ran out of tears when I was eighteen
So nobody made me but the main streets

I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga, then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never makin' money, ah

Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes

Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers

Escaping, her van is a Wonderland

Superstar lines back at the crib

We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo

We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it

Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me

""She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony""

Power is Power (feat. The Weeknd & Travis Scott),"Original Lyrics

[Перевод песни ""Power Is Power""]

[Куплет 1: The Weekend]
Я был рождён изо льда и снега
С зимними волками, в темноте, один
В самую дикую ночь я стал тем самым
И ты поймёшь, что ты мой, когда тишина придёт

[Пред-припев: The Weekend]
Тяжела корона только для слабого

[Припев: The Weekend]
Нож в моём сердце не смог замедлить меня
Потому что сила – это сила, мой огонь никогда не исчезает
Я вырос из страхов, ничто теперь не ранит меня
Потому что сила – это сила
Теперь смотри, как я сжигаю

[Куплет 2: SZA]
Я застала самую холодную войну
И я знаю, где была, ведь уже истекала кровью
Как мне знать, что тебе нужно остаться?
Как мне знать, что мы сделали по-твоему?
Ты бы не взял моё место
Отложи меня, я умру, глядя на твоё лицо
Как мне узнать? Кому я могу верить?
Чувства пустоты
Только любовь смогла убить меня, Бог благословит

[Припев: The Weekend, The Weekend & SZA]
Нож в моём сердце
Не смог замедлить меня (не смог замедлить меня)
Потому что сила – это сила (потому что сила – это сила)
Мой огонь никогда не исчезает
Я вырос из страхов
Ничто теперь не ранит меня (ничто не ранит меня)
Потому что сила – это сила (потому что сила – это сила)
Теперь смотри, как я сжигаю

[Куплет 3: Travis Scott]
Дыши, чувствуй воздух, который я вдыхаю (да)
Воздух, который я, воздух, который я вдыхаю (ух)
Кто горячее? Был монстром с короной (ух)
Затянут высокими водами, не опускай голову, можешь утонуть (ух)
В этом мире намного холоднее, день за днём ведём счёт
Был рядом, просто ждал пока она придёт
Я затянул, выкинул косяк за ворота, моя мелкая детка, убивай
Я носил флаг, наложи на моё лицо, никто не в безопасности
Сними маску, им придётся увидеть то, что они не развидят
Я забрал достаточно, поэтому вернул обратно
(До-до-до-до-до, да)
Опасность в моих мыслях (ах)
Нету ножа, кинжала, пули, которая сможет сделать это
Прежде чем ты, да, ты даже узнаешь, я пройду прямо сквозь это, да

[Пред-припев: SZA]
Тяжела корона, но никогда для королевы (о, да)

[Припев: SZA & The Weekend, The Weekend, Travis Scott]
Нож в моём сердце
Не смог замедлить меня (не смог замедлить меня)
Потому что сила – это сила (потому что сила – это сила)
Огонь никогда не исчезает (ох)
Я вырос из своих страхов (да)
Ничто сейчас не ранит меня (ничто не ранит меня)
Потому что сила – это сила (потому что сила – это сила)

off the table (with The Weeknd),"Title appears: THE SAD TALE OF HENRY THE ENGINE

NARRATOR: Once upon a time, on the Island of Sodor, there was a train named Henry. Henry was a freight train, and he pulled all kinds of important materials around. But then one day, Sir Topham Hatt had an idea.

Sir Topham Hatt is shown holding a chart that says ""PRECISION SCHEDULED RAILROADING"".

NARRATOR: And suddenly, Henry got longer, and longer, and longer.

Henry is seen being attached to multiple train carts, including natural gas, and is seen moving with it until he stops.

NARRATOR: Henry got so long, when he rested, he started getting in people's way, and drivers got very angry at him.

""What's the fucking hold up, train?"" said the driver. A little old lady shouted, ""Get fucked!""

Henry sighs.

NARRATOR: A little girl crawled underneath Henry on her way to school.

Steam comes out of Henry when she crawls underneath him.

""Oooh, that tickles,"" said Henry. ""I fucking hate you, train!"" said the little girl.

Henry looks annoyed.

NARRATOR: A fire engine pleaded with him to move.

""I can't move,"" said Henry. ""I don't have any room!""

NARRATOR: So they both just sat there, and watched the children's hospital burn.

A whistle is heard while the children's hospital is seen engulfed in flames.

NARRATOR: But Henry was told he was much more efficient now, which is another way of saying profitable, and 9 miles long.

Henry is seen carrying multiple train carts of natural gas, filling the entire land space on the screen.

NARRATOR: He carried all sorts of things people needed, like medical bandages, corn, vinyl chloride, fireworks, question mark, question mark, hand grenades, question mark, plugged-in space heaters, and all sorts of zoo animals.

Henry is seen talking with Sir Topham Hatt in the railway station.

""What's liquified natural gas, and why am I pulling 22 cars full of it?"", Henry asked. ""Never you mind,"" said Sir Topham Hatt. ""I mapped out this whole route out at home.""

""That's a weird thing to do, and I don't really know how to respond to it,"" said Henry. ""Just mind your business, like a good little rolling death machine,"" Sir Topham Hatt said.

""Sorry, I'm a WHAT?!"", asked Henry.

Henry is seen climbing up the hill with difficulty.

NARRATOR: Then, one day, a wheel on one of Henry's tank cars started overheating. His engineer hadn't had a chance to inspect it in months. Henry was getting worried.

""It seems my caboose is loose! I can't drive with a loose caboose,"" Henry told the driver, but it was too late. ""OH SHIT."" said Henry.

NARRATOR: Henry the Freight Train became Henry the Bomb Train.

Henry falls down the hill and his caboose explodes, derailing the train and injuring Henry in the process of exporting the goods to a nearby town. All of the tank cars are scattered around the town, leaked.

""Oh well,"" thought Henry. ""It could be worse, At least my tankers didn't expl-""

All of the tank cars with liquified natural gas explode, destroying the town.

NARRATOR: Meanwhile, in the other side of the island...

Thomas, while strolling down the windmill, notices a huge explosion.

""Oh dear,"" said Thomas.

NARRATOR: The explosion obliterated a significant part of the Island of Sodor.

Henry is seen caught in the fires of the now-obliterated town.

NARRATOR: Henry was so sad. Sir Topham Hatt had blood on his hands, but he didn't care. It wasn't his blood, and he could just wipe it off with all his new money.

A clip of the original Thomas the Tank Engine episode ""The Sad Story of Henry"" is seen where Henry is built a wall around his tunnel.

NARRATOR: As for Henry, he was taken out of commission and put in a tunnel. But as trains can't die, he just had to suffer forever, and ever. But I think he deserved his punishment, don't you?",-0.10538748690922603,Negative
Snowchild,"I used to pray when I was sixteen
If I didn't make it, then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin'
Couldn't even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving

Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex, give her Philip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis à la mode, nigga
And for that money, I been fiending
Cali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving

Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

Twenty mill' mansion, never lived in it
Zero edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin'
 and
Going on tour is my vacation
Every month another accusation
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience

So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving

Hawái - Remix,"[Letra de ""Hawái (Remix)""]

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Yeah
So now he's your heaven (Oh, yeah)
You're lying to yourself and him to make me jealous (Oh, no)
You put on such an act when you're sleepin' together
All this 'cause I said I don't want marriage (Marriage)
I don't want marriage (Hey)

[Pre-Coro: The Weeknd]
I'd rather go half on a baby
'Cause at least I know that it's not temporary (Temporary)
And at least we'll share something that's real (Oh, yeah)
I can tell that you're just tryna feel (Oh, no)

[Coro: The Weeknd & Maluma]
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacacione', mis fеlicitacione'
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que postеas (Oh, yeah)
Pa' que yo vea cómo te va, pa' que yo vea (Hah)
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacaciones (Ah), mis felicitaciones (Ah)
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas (Huh)
Pa' que yo vea cómo te va de bien, pero te haces mal
Porque el amor no se compra con na'

[Verso: Maluma]
Miéntele a todos tus seguidore'
Dile que los tiempo' de ahora son mejore'
No creo que cuando te llame me ignores
Si después de mí ya no habrán más amores
Tú y yo fuimo' uno
Lo hacíamo' en ayuna' antes del desayuno
Fumábamo' la hookah y te pasaba el humo
Y ahora en esta guerra no gana ninguno
Si me preguntas, nadie tiene culpa
A vece' los problemas a uno se le juntan
Déjame hablar, porfa, no me interrumpas
Si te hice algo malo, entonces discúlpame
La gente te lo va a creer, actúas bien ese papel (Yeah)
Baby, pero no eres feliz con él

[Coro: The Weeknd & Maluma]
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacacione' (Yeah), mis felicitacione'
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas (Oh, no)
Pa' que yo vea cómo te va, pa' que yo vea (Hah)
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacaciones (Ah), mis felicitaciones (Ah)
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas (Posteas)
Pa' que yo vea cómo te va de bien, pero te haces mal (Yeah)
Porque el amor no se compra con na'
